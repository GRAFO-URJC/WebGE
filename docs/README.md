# WebGE

Grammatical Evolution (GE) is a metaheuristic from the Genetic Programming family which allows to evolve individuals represented as chromosomes expressing their phenotypes by means of a grammar.

The main idea of this project is to create a web environment for Grammatical Evolution experimentation for **symbolic regression problems**. Hence,by means of a web interface, researchers will be able to configure, run and analyze their experiments with GE.

## Grammatical Evolution

Several GE implementations can be found at GitHub. Our first implementation, made in Java, can be found here: https://github.com/ABSysGroup/jeco.

Other nice implementations of GE, but based in Python:
 * PonyGE : https://github.com/PonyGE/PonyGE2
 * Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution (DSGE): https://github.com/nunolourenco/dsge
